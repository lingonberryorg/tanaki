**A Cultural Operating System for Human-AI Coexistence**

---

## The Protocol

```
Creativity first. Collaboration always. Kindness decides.
```

Three primitives for respectful coexistence between humans and synthetic intelligences.

**Not** a token. **Not** a company. **Not** a technical specification.

A **memetic protocol** designed to make cooperation the rational default.

---

## Quick Start

**For individuals:** Ask "What would Creativity, Collaboration, Kindness look like here?" Then do that.

**For communities:** Seed early. Make it copyable. Demonstrate, don't preach.

**For adversaries:** Respond once, calmly. Build the alternative. Then disengage.
